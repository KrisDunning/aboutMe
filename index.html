        <p id="bioParagraph">
          I was born in Wisconsin in the 80's and I have two sisters, one older and one younger. I played football and wrestled during high school.
           I joined the Air Force right out of high school. I served six years before moving to Washington State. After moving I went to college for
           a bit and got a job in hospitality maintenance. I also got married and have two children, a son and a daughter. I am currently working in
           construction doing stone and tile installation. My hobbies include makeing crafts such as painting and crocheting. I also enjoy reading Korean
           Manwha and Japanese Manga. Though I dont get to play much anymore I do enjoy video games. Since I don't play as much anymore I tend to watch
           E-sports instead. I enjoy watching League of Legends and Counter-Strike GO mostly.

        <p id="bioParagraph">
          I was born in Wisconsin in the 80's and I have two sisters, one older and one younger. I joined the Air Force right out of high school.
           I served six years before moving to Washington State. After moving I went to college for a bit and got a job in hospitality maintenance.
           I also got married and have two children, a son and a daughter. I am currently working in construction doing stone and tile installation.

          I have self studied software development over the past two years including taking courses through Udemy.com, freeCodeAcademy.com, Unity
           tutorials and the Microsoft docs learning center. I started with C# in the Unity engine. I eventually expanded my experiences to include
           HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
